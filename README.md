# AI-Resume-Matcher
AI Resume Matcher is an intelligent, local-first resume screening system powered by the Mistral 7B Instruct LLM. It takes a job description and multiple PDF resumes, compares each candidate’s experience, skills, and background, and generates a match percentage with a detailed reasoning report — all saved as Word documents.
